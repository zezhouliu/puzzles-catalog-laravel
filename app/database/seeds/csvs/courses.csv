We start with Newtonian mechanics, which envisions a universal time, symmetric between past and future. This leads to the concept of a clockwork universe. We then see how developments in the 19th and 20th centuries destroy this view of time. In the 19th century, the distinction between past and future emerges from considerations of statistical processes. In the 20th century, the theory of relativity forces fundamental changes in the concept of time. Time ceases to be universal and becomes entangled with space and gravity. Quantum mechanics limits the predictability of the future and introduces verified effects so weird that Einstein wrote of them, ""No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this.""",,"// Some knowledge of secondary school physics useful, but not required.

To be sure, Americans' access to food and the quality of the food they consume vary widely. But food is generally available. Whether found in supermarkets, farmer's markets, convenience stores, or restaurants of every variety, there is an abundance of food and a surfeit of choices. How did this come to be? How did high-yield agriculture develop? How did processed foods find their way to store shelves? To illuminate these questions and more, we will examine the history, technology, and politics of agricultural production throughout the twentieth century. We will also consider contemporary food production practices and ethical dilemmas about how food is produced. Course readings will cover how food has been cultivated, manufactured, and distributed, as well as the human labor behind some of these production stages.",,,"Th., 4-6",,

This last aspect has had the greatest impact in so far as it profoundly changed the conditions of art making and artistic culture. From the 16th century on, art works were to a large extent known through prints. One of the important preoccupations of the course will be what is transmitted through a printed image.

What does it mean to be a good teacher, doctor, social worker, lawyer, or business person? How does the bureaucratic arrangement of work change people's incentives, perceptions of their jobs, and their capacities to do their jobs well? This class will examine how people in various professional and occupational fields navigate the day-to-day demands of their work, with particular attention to how the demands of organizational life-rules, authority, formality, coordination-interact with the work itself. This course will draw on an array of research in the sociology of organizations, the sociology of occupations, and the sociology of professions. The goal of this course is to help students develop a research project in some professional or occupational field of their interest.",,"Required of and limited to Sociology concentrators.

In order to understand the dynamics of this process we will examine case studies beginning with the Korean War-era emergence of the term 'brainwashing', the American interdisciplinary science of ""coercive persuasion"" that arose in response, and successive waves of technological, political, and sociocultural developments.

The rest of the class will focus on classic applications, as well as recent research. Topics will include option pricing, optimal portfolio choice, economies with financial frictions, dynamic contracts and repeated games. Stochastic calculus can make dynamic models significantly more tractable. Continuous-time asset pricing is a clear evidence of that. The Black-Scholes formula significantly simplifies pricing, in comparison to the discrete-time methods based on binomial trees. There is tremendous potential to apply continuous-time methods in other areas of economics as well. Applications can be found in many fields, including corporate finance, macroeconomics, market microstructure and industrial organizations.","Graduate-level course in microeconomic theory.
